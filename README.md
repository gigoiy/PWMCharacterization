# PWM Signal Simulation & Characterization Project
Thank you for checking out this project! Although, this project doesn't haven't any special use other than to showcase my skills, feel free to clone this repo and play around with it for whatever reason you may have!
## Things You Should Know
* algorithm.py uses matplotlib, scipy, and numpy libraries and Python3. Be sure to download those.
* For LaTeX editing, you could use Overleaf, but if you're using VS Code, download the LaTeX language support and LaTeX Workshop extensions and be sure to follow the installation instructions for LaTeX Workshop.
* There is already a pre-compiled PDF of the LaTeX document provided in this repo called finalDocument.pdf as well as the source code for that document called finalDocument.tex.
* Images of the plots are provided and they will also save a new one every time you run the Python code. If you don't want this to happen, be sure to comment out the lines where it saves the plots as PNGs.
